1. for (i = 0; i < 32; i++ )

You can end loop iff n == 0;

so while(n != 0) is better here. 

2. IMPORTANT: Read the following code:

class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int res = 0;
        while(n) {
            res ++;
            n&=(n-1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};

Understand why it can be a solution for bitcount.
And why it is faster.

If you can't understand it. ping me.
